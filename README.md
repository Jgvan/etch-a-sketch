# etch-a-sketch
A Etch-A-Sketch website.

The website will have a canvas with a variable number of "pixels" in a grid up to a maximum of 100x100.
When the mouse moves over the blocks they will change color. Initially to black but later add option to have random colors

This project is based on the requirements of [The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).
