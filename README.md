# etch-a-sketch
A Etch-A-Sketch website.

Create a canvas with variable pixel size. User inputs a value to decide how many pixels should be inside the canvas.
When the mouse moves over the blocks they will change color. Initially to black but later add option to have random colors.

This project is based on the requirements of [The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).
