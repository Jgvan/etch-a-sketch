# etch-a-sketch
A Etch-A-Sketch website.

Starts with a 16x16 canvas. When the user resets the canvas they can change number from to anywhere between 2 and 100.
When the mouse moves over the blocks they will change color. Over subsequent passes they will get darker each time by reducing each colour value inside rgba() by 25.

This project is based on the requirements of [The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).
